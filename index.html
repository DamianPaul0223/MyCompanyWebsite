      This is Nojang. We are a video game development team that's been copied and used by other development teams.
      We have dealt with lots of copyright claims lately, but we will still strive to give people like you
      the <i>ultimate</i> gaming experience.

        <p>We made this game called BlockTech. Ever heard of the game called Minecraft? Well, those dudes copied us.</p>

        <img id="cobaltimage" src="images/cobalt logo.jpg" alt="Cobalt Image">
        <p>This is Cobalt. It's a game that a development team known as Mojang stole from us. We are currently trying to sue them.</p>
